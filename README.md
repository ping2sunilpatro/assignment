### Spring Boot CRUD Application
---
To create a simple Spring Boot CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application involves several steps:
* Create Spring Boot project using **Spring Initializer** (https://start.spring.io/)
* Add dependencies
  - Spring Web (for RESTful APIs)
  - Spring Data JPA (for ORM and database interaction)
  - H2 Database (for an embedded database)
  - MySQL Database (as an external database)
  - Spring Boot DevTools (for live reloading during development)
  - Lombok (to avoid boilerplate code)
  - Spring Security (for HTTP Basic Authentication)
  - Spring Validation (for bean validation)
  - Jackson-databind library (to handle the automatic conversion between Java objects to and from JSON)
  - MapStruct library (to reduce the amount of manual mapping code in your application)
  - Spring Actuator (provides essential endpoints to expose application metrics, health, and management data)
  - Prometheus (collect, store, and analyze these metrics, enabling proactive monitoring and alerting)
* Define Entity model
  - **Customer** entity that has an embedded **Phonenumber** entity
    <p align="center">
      <img src="./assets/entity.png" alt="Statoscope example" width="650">
    </p>
* Create a Repository interface - **CustomerRepository** class extends JPARepository that will automatically implement basic CURD operations
* Create a Service class - **CustomerService** class that acts as a bridge between Controller and Repository class. It contains all the business logic
* Create a Controller class - **CustomerController** class it is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, processing them, and returning appropriate responses.
* Configure **application.yaml** file in a Spring Boot application for profiling, database connection settings, a connection pool, security configuration, Prometheus integration and Actuator
* Compile the application
  ```mvn
  mvn clean install
  ```
* Run the application
  ```mvn
  mvn spring-boot:run
  ```
* Once your application is up and running, you can access the following endpoints:
  - **GET /api/customers**: Retrieve all Customers
  - **GET /api/customers/{id}**: Retrieve an Customer by ID
  - **POST /api/customers**: Create a new Customer
  - **PUT /api/customers/{id}**: Update an existing Customer
  - **DELETE /api/customers/{id}**: Delete an Customer

### Feature that are implemented in this application
---
* Implemented **Versioning** concept to track changes made to Customer entity
* Used **@embedded** and **@embeddable** concept to make PhoneNumber as composite dataType
* Used **Mapper** - CustomerMapper interface for converting between different object types (CustomerRequest to Customer and Customer to CustomerResponse class)
* Used **RequestFilter** class to get PATH, ENV data and **RequestLoggingFilter** class to get PODNAME.
* Used **Spring Security** framework to implement HTTP Basic Authentication for all the CRUD Rest APIs
* Implemented **Slf4j logging** framework
* Implemented **GlobalExceptionHandling** concept using **@RestControllerAdvice**
* Taken care of proper response structure for success and error scenarios
* Used **Profiling** concept to separate configurations for different environments
* Implemented **Validation** using **@valid** annotation to validate the request body while creating or updating a customer
* Configured **Spring Boot Actuator** to gather insights into application's health, performance and overall metrics data
* Configured **Prometheus** for collecting, storing, and querying metrics from various services
* Visualizing metrics that Prometheus collect from Spring Boot application using **Grafana**

### This application has 4 environments - DEV, TEST, UAT3, PROD
---
- **Dev environment** is selected by default, when application is run **Locally**. This is for developing
- **TEST environment** is for Testing the application - Unit Testing and Integration Testing
- **UAT3 environment** is used when application is used as **Dockerized Application**
- **PROD environment** is used when application is used in **Minikube - Running in Kubernetes**
  
### Important things to note
---
* **H2 database** for **Testing the framework**
* **MYSQL** used for **DEV, UAT3 and PROD environment**
* **Prometheus and Grafana** is only setup in UAT3 envrionment
* Application is **secure** at all environment
* **AutoScaling** and **LoadBalancing** is taken care only in PROD environment

### Project Structure
---
<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/projectstructure_1.png" width="650">
</p>

### Build the application without Running Tests
---
* Once code is ready, use the below command to clean the project, install the necessary dependencies, and package the application. The -DskipTests flag skips the test execution during the build process.
  ```
  mvn clean install -DskipTests
  ```
### Run the application Locally which is DEV environment
---
* Once the project is build, make sure to have the mysql container up and running in docker desktop that must be created as a part of Prerequisities step     [Need docker-compose file for creating mysql container named **library**](#Prerequisities-needed)
  <p align="center">
      <img src="./assets/docker_mySQLContainer.png" width="650">
  </p>
* Run Spring boot application locally using the following Maven command. By default profile selected is **dev** environment
  ```
  mvn spring-boot:run 
  ```
* To run the application on different ports
  ```
  mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="--server.port=8081"
  ```
* Run the packaged **JAR** file instead of using mvn spring-boot:run
  ```
  java -jar target\myapp-1.0.jar
  ```
* Test the application
```

### Test the application with unit and integration testing -- TEST Environment
---
* Run the unit testing
  ```
  # To test CustomerController class
  mvn -Dtest=CustomerControllerTest test

  # To test CustomerService class
  mvn -Dtest=CustomerServiceTest test
  ```
* To Run specific method in specific class
  ```
  mvn -Dtest=CustomerControllerTest#testGetCustomerById test
  ```
* Run both unit and integration testing. For integration testing, we are using **Test** profile which is our **TEST** environment. It takes the username and password to authenticate from [application-test.yaml](myapp/src/main/resources/application-test.yaml)
  ```
  mvn test
  ```
### To automate the CI/CD pipeline for your Spring Boot application using GitHub Actions
---
* This GitHub Actions workflow automates the process of building and deploying a Spring Boot application.
Please refer to [ci_cd_pipeline.yml](.github/workflows/ci_cd_pipeline.yml)
* It includes:
  - Build
    - Setting up Java and Docker environments
    - Building the application with Maven
    - Running tests
    - Package it
    - Build the docker image
    - Push the docker image
  - Deploy
    - Setting up Java and Docker-Compose environments
    - Deploy the mysql Container using [docker_compose.yml](myapp/docker/mysqlContainer/docker-compose.yml)
    - Build 
    - Run the application
      > **Note**
      > This CRUD Spring Boot application will connect to external MYSQL database running in mysql Container in docker
    - Verify the health of the application
      
 ### Run the Spring Boot CRUD application in Dockerized Environment  -- UAT3 Environment
 ---
 * Stop the mysql container that is running in docker desktop as part of Prerequisities step [Need docker-compose file for creating mysql container named **library**](#Prerequisities-needed). Otherwise, there will be port conflict of 3306.
 * Stop the Spring Boot CRUD application which is running locally in port 8080. Otherwise, there will be a port conflict of 8080.
 * Now, start the Docker containers, networks, and volumes associated with a docker-compose project using [docker_compose.yml](myapp/docker/docker-compose.yml)
 ```
 docker-compose up
 ```
 * **docker** network gets created under which we have app-1, mysql-db, prometheus, grafana containers which are attached to each other
   <p align="center">
      <img src="./assets/dockerNetwork.png" width="650">
   </p>
 * Some basic commands that we can run -
   ```

 ### For the Metrics Monitoring
 ---
 
 * Open the prometheus url
   ```
   http://localhost:9090/
   ```
 * Check the **process cpu usage**
   <p align="center">
      <img src="./assets/prometheus_1.png" width="650">
   </p>
 * Check the **http server requests active seconds count**
   <p align="center">
      <img src="./assets/prometheus_2.png" width="650">
   </p>
 * Similarly, open the grafana url to visualize the prometheus data. For the first time it will ask for username:password give admin/admin and set the new password as admin.
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/
   ```
   <p align="center">
      <img src="./assets/grafana_1.png" width="650">
   </p>
 ### Run the Spring Boot CRUD application in Kubernetes cluster managed by Minikube  -- PROD Environment

##### Some basic commands of kubectl
     
 * To see the list of running pods
   ```
   kubectl get pods
   ```
   
 * To see the services running in Kubernetes
   ```
   kubectl get services
   ```
   
 * To see the deployments in your Kubernetes cluster
   ```
   kubectl get deployments
   ```
   
 * Check the logs of a specific pod
   ```
   kubectl logs <pod-name>
   ```
   
 * Check deployment events
   ```
   kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>
   ```
   
 * To enter into any pods and run commands directly inside the container
   ```
   # Getting inside the container
   kubectl exec -it spring-boot-app-9f4c5bc9-v6jxx -- /bin/bash

   # Seeing the envrionment variable inside the container
   root@spring-boot-app-9f4c5bc9-v6jxx:/app# env
   ```

 * To list all configmap 
   ```
   kubectl get configmaps
   ```

 * To view a configmap 
   ```
   kubectl get configmap <configmap-name> -o yaml
   ```
   
 * To list all secrets
   ```
   kubectl get secrets
   ```

 * To view a secret
   ```
   kubectl get secret <secret-name> -o yaml
   ```

 * To delete the pods, service, deployment, hpa, configmap, secret
   ```
   # To delete the Horizontal Pod AutoScaler (hpa)
   kubectl apply -f spring-boot-app-hpa.yaml

   # To delete the deployment of spring-boot-app container
   kubectl delete deployment spring-boot-app

   # To delete the deployment of mysql container
   kubectl delete deployment mysql-deployment

   # To delete the service of spring-boot-app
   kubectl delete service spring-boot-service

   # To delete the service of mysql
   kubectl delete service mysql-service

   # To delete the config map
   kubectl delete configmap app-config

   # To delete the secret
   kubectl delete secret db-secret
   ```
 * To stop the minikube
   ```
   minikube stop
   ```

 ### To configure AutoScaling using Horizontal Pod AutoScaler (hpa)
 ---
 * Ensure metrics server is installed. As the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler relies on the Metrics Server to gather resource usage metrics (like CPU and memory) for 
   your pods
   ```
   kubectl get deployment metrics-server -n kube-system
   ```
   <p align="center">
      <img src="./assets/metrics.png" width="650">
   </p>

 * If it's not installed, you can install it using the following commands:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
   ```
   
* Create a **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler** deployment file [See here](myapp/kubernetes/spring-boot-app-hpa.yaml)
* Apply the hpa file
  ```
  kubectl apply -f spring-boot-app-hpa.yaml
  ```
  
* Once HPA is created, and you can see the status of it
  ```
  kubectl get hpa
  ```
 ### For Configuring the LoadBalacing
 * Make sure in the spring-boot-service.yaml file you need to use the **type as LoadBalancer**, which means it this application will provision an external load       balancer [Check the file](myapp/kubernetes/spring-boot-service.yaml)

 
 ### Test the Autoscaler
 * To get the list of pods, services, deployment and hpa
 ```
 kubectl get pods,svc,deployment,hpa
 ```
 <p align="center">
   <img src="./assets/autoscaler_1.png" width="650">
 </p>

 * Run the powershell and hit the getCustomers api in infinite loop
 <p align="center">
   <img src="./assets/powershell.png" width="650">
 </p> 

 * After sometime, check the hpa status. We will see the cpu usage got increased. We have configured in hpa yaml file that if it increase by 50% then autoscale       the springboot application pod. And thats what we are seeing in the below screenshot
 ```
 kubectl get pods,svc,deployment,hpa
 ```
  <p align="center">
   <img src="./assets/autoscaler_2.png" width="650">
 </p> 

 
 ### Test the LoadBalancing
 * Check the logs of all the pods of spring-boot-app. You will see the request are getting distributed between different pods
 ```
 # To see the logs of all the spring-boot-app pods
 kubectl logs spring-boot-app-6d547cd469-9m6wn
 kubectl logs spring-boot-app-6d547cd469-hfhnw
 kubectl logs spring-boot-app-6d547cd469-jhfj8
 kubectl logs spring-boot-app-6d547cd469-n92b2
 kubectl logs spring-boot-app-6d547cd469-vr6xt
 ```
 ### Created a Testing Framework Application, a command-line based that consumes the SpringBoot CRUD application
 ---
 
 * Make sure to have the mysql container up and running in docker desktop that must be created as a part of Prerequisities step     [Need docker-compose file for creating mysql container named **library**](#Prerequisities-needed)
  <p align="center">
      <img src="./assets/docker_mySQLContainer.png" width="650">
  </p>
  
* Run Spring boot application locally using the following Maven command at **port 8080**. By default profile selected is **dev** environment
  ```
  mvn spring-boot:run 
  ```
  
* Once it is confirmed, Spring Boot CRUD application is up and running
* Then, run the testingFmk CLI application at **port 8082**
* Once it start, it was show a switch-case structure in your command-line application that consumes the REST API endpoints of a CRUD Spring Boot application. Like shown in below screenshot.
